1. The "Win Condition" Rule

Feature: User submits a deck with P.E.K.K.A., Mega Knight, and Wizard.

AI Analysis: Critical Error. You have no "Win Condition" (a card that targets buildings reliably). Mega Knight and P.E.K.K.A. are easily distracted by 1-elixir skeletons. You need a tower-targeter to actually win the game.

Example Tip: "Swap Mega Knight for Battle Ram or Hog Rider to ensure you can damage the enemy tower."

2. The "Two-Spell" Standard

Feature: User submits a deck with only Zap.

AI Analysis: Vulnerability Detected. Most competitive decks require two spells: a 'Small Spell' (2-3 elixir) for swarms and a 'Big Spell' (4+ elixir) for finishing towers and killing medium troops.

Example Tip: "Add Fireball or Poison. If the opponent places a Wizard or Musketeer next to their tower, your Zap alone cannot punish them."

3. Average Elixir Cost (Cycle)

Feature: User submits a deck with 5.2 Average Elixir (Golem, Three Musketeers, PEKKA).

AI Analysis: Deck Too Heavy. You will be defenseless in 'Single Elixir' (the first 2 minutes). If you play one card, you will have 0 elixir left while your opponent attacks the other lane.

Example Tip: "Aim for an average cost between 3.0 and 4.0. Replace Three Musketeers with Bomber to defend cheaply."

4. Air Defense Check

Feature: User submits a deck with Valkyrie, Prince, Mini PEKKA, and Bomber.

AI Analysis: Fatal Flaw. You have zero reliable air counters. A single Balloon or Lava Hound will take your King Tower immediately because these ground troops cannot look up.

Example Tip: "Swap Prince for Musketeer or Electro Wizard to secure your airspace."

5. The "Tank Killer" Role

Feature: User submits a deck with only splash troops (Wizard, Witch, Baby Dragon).

AI Analysis: Low DPS (Damage Per Second). While you can kill swarms easily, a high-health tank (Golem or Electro Giant) will walk through your splash damage and destroy your tower.

Example Tip: "You need a high-damage single-target unit. Swap Witch for Mini P.E.K.K.A. or Inferno Dragon."

Phase 2: Synergy & Archetypes
6. Synergy: Tornado + Splash

Feature: User submits a deck with Executioner or Magic Archer but uses Arrows.

AI Analysis: Missed Synergy. Executioner and Magic Archer rely on geometry (lining up targets). Without Tornado to clump enemies together, these cards lose 50% of their value.

Example Tip: "Swap Arrows for Tornado. This allows you to pull all enemy troops into your Executioner’s axe path."

7. Synergy: The "Tank + Graveyard" Combo

Feature: User plays Graveyard but has no tank (Knight/Giant) or Freeze.

AI Analysis: Ineffective Win Condition. Graveyard skeletons are easily killed by the tower if nothing is tanking the tower's shots. You need a 'meat shield.'

Example Tip: "Add Knight or Giant. Play them at the bridge first, then cast Graveyard so the tower targets the tank, not the skeletons."

8. Bait Synergy

Feature: User puts Goblin Barrel in a deck with no other swarm cards.

AI Analysis: Easy to Counter. If Goblin Barrel is your only 'bait' card, the opponent will save their Log for it every single time. You need other cards that force them to use their spell.

Example Tip: "Add Goblin Gang or Princess. If they Log the Princess, your Goblin Barrel is safe to land."

9. Conflicting Archetypes

Feature: User pairs Golem (Beatdown) with Hog Rider (Cycle).

AI Analysis: Identity Crisis. Golem wants to build a slow, massive push. Hog Rider wants to play fast and out-cycle the opponent. Doing both makes you mediocre at both.

Example Tip: "Commit to one style. If you keep Golem, add Night Witch (support). If you keep Hog, add Ice Spirit (cycle)."

10. Building Necessity

Feature: User has no defensive building (Cannon, Tesla, Tombstone).

AI Analysis: Kiting Issue. Without a building, cards like Hog Rider and Balloon will go straight for your Princess Tower. A building allows you to pull them into the center, engaging both towers.

Example Tip: "Add Tesla or Cannon. Placing it in the center pulls the Hog Rider away from your tower, taking zero damage."

Phase 3: Advanced Mechanics (Pro Level)
11. The "Reset" Mechanic

Feature: User has no Zap, Electro Wizard, or Electro Spirit.

AI Analysis: Vulnerable to Ramping Damage. If the opponent plays Inferno Dragon or Sparky, you have no way to 'reset' their charge. They will melt your tanks instantly.

Example Tip: "Include Zap or Electro Spirit to stun targets and reset their damage ramp-up."

12. Champion Usage (The 3-Card Cycle)

Feature: User isn't using a Champion (if unlocked) in a cycle deck.

AI Analysis: Cycle Efficiency. Champions have a unique mechanic: while they are alive on the map, they are removed from your card rotation. This shortens your deck to 3 cards, allowing you to get back to your Win Condition faster.

Example Tip: "Add Golden Knight or Little Prince. Keep them alive to cycle back to your Hog Rider faster."

13. Role Redundancy

Feature: User includes Wizard, Executioner, and Witch.

AI Analysis: Redundant Roles. All three are expensive (5 elixir) splashers. You are paying too much for the same job. You only need one dedicated splasher.

Example Tip: "Keep Executioner (best stats). Swap Wizard for a Spirit (1 elixir) to make your deck faster."

14. Evolution Slots

Feature: User submits a deck with no Evolution card selected.

AI Analysis: Stat Disadvantage. Evolutions are strictly better versions of normal cards. Playing without one puts you at a mathematical disadvantage.

Example Tip: "You have Knight in your deck. Ensure you toggle the Evolution Slot on him to get the shielding bonus."

15. Bridge Spam Pressure

Feature: User plays P.E.K.K.A. but has no "Punishment" cards (Bandit, Royal Ghost).

AI Analysis: Lack of Dual-Lane Pressure. P.E.K.K.A. is a defensive card. When you defend successfully, you need to pressure the other lane immediately so the opponent can't defend your P.E.K.K.A. easily.

Example Tip: "Add Bandit or Royal Ghost. When the opponent spends elixir to stop your P.E.K.K.A., drop Bandit at the bridge in the opposite lane."

16. The "Big Spell" Check (Heavy Beatdown)

Feature: User plays Lava Hound but uses Rocket.

AI Analysis: Anti-Synergy. Rocket is too expensive for a Lava Hound deck and doesn't synergize with the Pups. You need spells that support your specific units.

Example Tip: "Swap Rocket for Fireball or Arrows. Arrows instantly kill Minions that try to eat your Lava Pups."

17. Defensive Counter-Push

Feature: User defends everything with Skeleton Army and Minion Horde.

AI Analysis: Spell Value Risk. Your defense relies entirely on "glass" troops that die to Arrows/Zap. Once they die, you have no units left on the map to counter-attack.

Example Tip: "Use troops that survive spells, like Bowler or Valkyrie. After they defend, they stay alive to lead an attack."

18. Starting Hand Logic

Feature: User has 4 spells and 1 building in the deck.

AI Analysis: Brick Risk. You have a high chance of a 'bad starting hand' (e.g., all spells). If the opponent plays a Golem at the back, you have no troop to place.

Example Tip: "Limit yourself to 2-3 spells maximum. Ensure you have at least 3 cards you are happy playing as a first move (e.g., Archers, Knight, Spirit)."

19. Miner Control Synergy

Feature: User plays Miner but uses Clone and Rage.

AI Analysis: Misunderstanding Archetype. Miner is a 'Chip' damage card, not a 'Beatdown' card. He relies on slow, consistent damage (Poison) rather than sudden bursts (Clone/Rage).

Example Tip: "Miner pairs best with Poison or Wall Breakers. Use Poison to kill the troops they place to catch your Miner."

20. Elixir Pump Rules

Feature: User adds Elixir Collector to a 2.6 Hog Cycle deck.

AI Analysis: Strategic Mismatch. Elixir Collector is an investment card for expensive decks (Golem/3M) to build a massive advantage later. Cycle decks need to win now by out-pacing.

Example Tip: "Remove Pump. In a cheap deck, you generate advantage by making 'positive elixir trades' on defense, not by building pumps."
